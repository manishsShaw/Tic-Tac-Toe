## Game Mechanics:

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Two players take turns placing their marks (**X** and **O**) in empty squares.

- If all nine squares are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

- Real-time score updates for each player.
- Visual effects (e.g., highlighting the winning combination).

## Responsive Design:

- The game is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, making it playable on desktop, tablet, or mobile devices.

## JavaScript Functionality:

- Event listeners for user interaction.
- Game logic to check for a winner or a draw.
- DOM manipulation to update the game board and scores dynamically.
- Option to restart the game after a round.
